# Google Logo Asset

## How to Add Google Logo

To use the official Google logo in the Sign-In button:

1. **Download the Google logo:**
   - Go to: https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines
   - Download the official "G" logo (PNG format, 24x24 or higher)
   - Or use this direct link: https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/2.0.0/images/auth/google.svg

2. **Save the file:**
   - Save as: `google_logo.png`
   - Location: `/assets/images/google_logo.png`

3. **Alternative - Use Icon Instead:**
   The button already has a fallback that shows a "G" icon if the image is not found.
   This works perfectly fine for development!

## Current Status

✅ The button will work WITHOUT the logo image (shows "G" icon as fallback)
✅ Add the logo later for a more polished look
